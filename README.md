Bird game 3 but dice instead of birds 

ts gonna be final repo, trust


actual imp plan

need me a farkle game 

die with custom faces, and custom weights for each face

need to be able to init a die with custom faces and weights

need to be able to see a die's stats and modify the face values

need to roll a die

need a container for the dice, prob an array or a dict with die name / id as the key

die contaainer -> id hidden to end user, name, color, upgrades, and the die itself, this needs to be a class or an interface

die container array / dict, idk where this needs to go but this will sue the id as the key and the die container itself as the value, when the game inits create 6 dice with default faces and weights and add them to the array / dict
